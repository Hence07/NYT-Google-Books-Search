NYT-Google-Books-Search

We will be creating a React-based Google Books Search app. We will also be building React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. To finish we will be using Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
